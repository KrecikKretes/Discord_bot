# Discord_bot
I was trying to create bot to Discord. Few months ago it works, but now I must check few things.

Kretbot have prefix <3. It should
- after use command:
    -"hug" with ping someone, send a message ""Ping that person" Someone wants hug You. Do you hug him/her back? :hugging:" with random gif from https://g.tenor.com  with tag "hug", if you don't ping anyone, bot send "To hug you need 2 or more people, know you?" 
    -"hello", send a message "Hello"
    -"EasyGirl", send a message "I love You <3"
    -"Romantic", send random gif from https://g.tenor.com  with tag "love bear"
    -"Kiss", send a random gif from https://g.tenor.com  with tag "cute kiss"
    -"ilove" with ping someone, send a message ""Ping that person" Someone love You :point_right: :point_left:" with a random gif from httpp://g.tenor.com with tag "love", if you don't ping anyone, bot send "But who do you love?"
    -"bunny" with ping someone, send a message ""Ping that person" Someone send you a sweet bunny" with a random gif from httpp://g.tenor.com with tag "bunny", if you don't ping anyone, bot send "You can't send someone a bunny without someone"
    -"helpo" show all commands

-Some commadns like hug or ilove create a message with reaction. If someone give another one to that message, bot will send ":point_right: :point_left: Oh how sweet!!! :point_right: :point_left:"
